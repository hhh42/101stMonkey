<h3 id="toc_0">So you want to blog?</h3>

<p>Well more like I need to do some writing.
I wanted something simple something I didn&rsquo;t have to fight.  I just want a place to enter some text and it should look nice without some hassle making or hosting it.  This of course leads you to find all these fancy static site generators.   I was recommended <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and quickly found lots of text that made it sounds all very wonderful.  I liked the range of templating capabilites.  Seemed to be designed for hackers etc&hellip;  All good on paper and for many clearly capable.</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> was my second choice and this was built on it so it must be wonderful, and I&rsquo;m sure it is.  I wouldn&rsquo;t know.
Let&rsquo;s just say my first experience with Ruby wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant one.  I&rsquo;m the kind of guy that makes fun of Ruby.  I think this <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/Why-Ruby-Should-Stay-a-Laughing-Stock">guy</a> has the right of it.</p>

<p>For some inexplicable reason I couldn&rsquo;t get everything to install. Granted I didn&rsquo;t try in any real &ldquo;pull up the sleaves&rdquo; kind of way, but the point of this project was to bet quick and easy.  I made a few stabs, tried a few different distro&rsquo;s.  I got various inscrutible errors that didn&rsquo;t result much from google.  Let&rsquo;s go play with RVM yeah, that&rsquo;ll be fun because what you need from your toy langauges is multiple versions &ldquo;managed&rdquo;.  Aren&rsquo;t toy languages supposed to be easy and fun to setup?  Isn&rsquo;t that half the appeal, low overhead and maintenance?  Aren&rsquo;t the Ruby folk all &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have these kinds of problems like the PHP folk!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Anyway, I should probably save bashing Ruby and other toy languages for a more in depth focused series of comments but for now I&rsquo;d like to thank their gross inadequacies and the fine correlative capabilites of <a href="http://www.staticgen.com/">staticgen</a> because I started from the top and went until I found a real language.  Ohh look <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> is a real language!  I think I&rsquo;ll try <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and sure enough within a few short minutes everything was working and I was picking themes.</p>

<p>Something tells me Hugo will be a tad faster than a Ruby Hello world&hellip;. so far I haven&rsquo;t seen it go over 20ms.</p>
