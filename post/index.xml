&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;So you want to blog?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well more like I need to do some writing.
I wanted something simple something I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to fight.  I just want a place to enter some text and it look nice without some hassle hosting it.  This of course leads you to find all these fancy static site generators.   I was recommended Octapres and quickly found lots of text that made it sounds all very wonderful.  I liked the range of templating capabilites.  Seemed to be designed for hackers etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyl was my second choice and this was built on it so it must be wonderful, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is.  I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know.
Let&amp;rsquo;s just say my first experience with Ruby wasn&amp;rsquo;t a pleasant one.  I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of guy that makes fun of Ruby.  I think this &lt;a href=&#34;http://codefol.io/posts/Why-Ruby-Should-Stay-a-Laughing-Stock&#34;&gt;guy&lt;/a&gt; has the right of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some inexplicable reason I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get everything to install. Granted I didn&amp;rsquo;t try in any real &amp;ldquo;pull up the sleaves&amp;rdquo; kind of way, but the point of this project was to bet quick and easy.  I made a few stabs, tried a few different distro&amp;rsquo;s.  I got various inscrutible errors that didn&amp;rsquo;t result much from google.  Let&amp;rsquo;s go play with RVM yeah, that&amp;rsquo;ll be fun because what you need from your toy langauges is multiple versions &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo;.  Aren&amp;rsquo;t toy languages supposed to be easy and fun to setup?  Isn&amp;rsquo;t that half the appeal, low overhead and maintenance?  Aren&amp;rsquo;t the Ruby folk all &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have these kinds of problems like the php folk!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I should probably save bashing Ruby and other toy languages for a more in depth focused series of comments but for now I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank their gross inadequacies and the fine correlative capabilites of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.staticgen.com/&#34;&gt;staticgen&lt;/a&gt; because I started from the top and went until I found a real language.  Ohh look &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; is a real language!  I think I&amp;rsquo;ll try &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and sure enough within a few short minutes everything was working and I was picking themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something tells me Hugo will be a tad faster than a Ruby Hello world&amp;hellip;. so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it go over 20ms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;tests 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;test 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like apples and banannas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is a test of code insert

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a Gist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/hhh42/5e2a6a06db5d4eff1517.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;short gist ?
{{% gist 5e2a6a06db5d4eff1517 %}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe some html?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{% highlight html %}}
    &lt;section id=&#34;main&#34;&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
       &lt;h1 id=&#34;title&#34;&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
    {{ range .Data.Pages }}
        {{ .Render &amp;ldquo;summary&amp;rdquo;}}
    {{ end }}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
{{%/highlight%}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go?
{{% highlight go %}} A bunch of code here {{%/highlight%}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be scala ?
{{% highlight scala %}}
class CSPResultConverter {
  def convert(assignment: Assignment): Set[TileInstance] = {
    //    val tileVariables: List[Variable] = for (foo &amp;lt;- assignment.getVariables.iterator()) yield foo
    (for (variable &amp;lt;- assignment.getVariables) yield {
      variable match {
        case tv: TileVariable =&amp;gt; new TileInstance(tv.tileSpot,
          forceTile(assignment.getAssignment(tv)))
        case _ =&amp;gt; {
          println(&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this case?&amp;rdquo;)
          TileInstance.noTile
        }
      }
    }).toSet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}
}
{{%/highlight%}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ template &amp;ldquo;_internal/disqus.html&amp;rdquo; . }}&lt;/p&gt;
